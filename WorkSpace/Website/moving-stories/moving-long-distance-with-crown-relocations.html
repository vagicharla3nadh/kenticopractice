<p>I completed these moving furniture Case Studies following a series of in depth interviews with customers who have recently moved with Crown. I wanted to better understand the relocations experience of actual customers, for the benefit of Crown's improvement programme and for other potential customers considering the services of a professional moving company.</p>

<h1>Moving Across Town with Crown Relocations </h1>
<p class="bold-red"><strong>Henry and Mrs. Claudie Lawrence moved from Blenheim to Greymouth for work-related reasons, with their 12 year old son Sam and pet cat. Henry works for a large engineering firm who sponsored their move; giving the family a set allowance to cover the costs associated with moving their personal effects. They did not receive any settlement assistance in addition to the removal costs. Although moving to a completely new area may seem a daunting task for some, the Lawrence family had no apprehension or concerns, they were excited.</strong></p>

<p class="pullquote-right">Have that communication line open. And if you want to know something ...ask.</p>

<p>When it came to selecting the right mover, the company’s preferred supplier was Crown Relocations. However, Claudie contacted other companies for quotes and found Crown to be the quickest to respond, leaving a good first impression on the family members. All moving companies were found through the telephone book and were all described by Claudie as "very helpful". The deciding factors in choosing Crown were their ability to meet the families plan (in terms of moving time/date etc.), and the employers existing relationship with them, "it was just an easier option for us". With Henry’s company looking after much of the communication with Crown it was a straightforward choice for the Lawrence’s. The family arranged their own insurance (their allowance covered this), Claudie was in touch with their insurance company and "they said it was insured in transit." She insists there was nothing Crown could have done better at this stage; "they were very good".</p>

<p>When it came time for the actual move, the removals crew were "all very professional, kind, friendly and helpful. I had a really nice bunch of guys", said Claudie. They were very well prepared and informed. At this stage of the move, Crown maintained an open line of communication with the family, ensuring all was going smoothly and there were no problems occurring. The packing crew displayed a high level of expertise and they had a great sense of humour, helping the Lawrence’s warm to Crown.</p>

<p class="pullquote-left">all very professional, kind, friendly and helpful. I had a really nice bunch of guys.</p>

<p>Claudie was more than happy with her experience with Crown Relocations. The highlights for her were; "the constant communication and the guys had a great sense of humour". There was nothing in particular that Crown could have done better for her, confirming that she would definitely use the service again for any future relocation matters. Claudie offers this suggestion for anybody in the process of moving with a professional mover; "Have that communication line open. And if you want to know something ...ask."</p>

<p>With respect to learnings for Crown, it is great to know that the employer’s faith in Crown as the "preferred supplier" was well founded. With a company sponsored move the responsibility of the mover is to ensure the company is well represented at this stressful time. Claudie has reaffirmed that open lines of communication are very important, and in this instance Crown has performed very well.</p>
